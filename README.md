Flr (Flutter-R): a CLI tool likes `AAPT`(Android Asset Packaging Tool), which can help flutter developer to auto specify assets in `pubspec.yaml` and generate `R.dart` file after he changes the flutter project assets. With `R.dart`,  flutter developer can apply the asset in code by referencing it's asset ID.

## Feature

- Support auto service that automatically specify assets in `pubspec.yaml` and generate  `R.dart` file,  which can be triggered manually or by monitoring asset changes
- Support for processing image assets ( `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.icon`, `.bmp`, `.wbmp`, `.svg` ) 
- Support for processing text assets ( `.txt`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.xml` ) 
- Support for processing [image asset variants](https://flutter.dev/docs/development/ui/assets-and-images#asset-variants)
- Support for processing asset whichâ€™s filename is bad:
   - filename has illegal character (such as  `blank`,  `~`, `@`, `#` ) which is outside the range of  valid characters (`0-9`, `A-Z`, `a-z`, `_`,  `$`)
   - filename begins with a number or character `_`  or character`$`
   

## Installation & Update Flr

To install or update Flr, run `sudo gem install flr`

> If you want to use Flr tool on the Windows system, you are strongly recommended to run it on [WSL(Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10) environment !!! 

## Uninstall Flr

To uninstall  Flr run `sudo gem uninstall flr`

## Usage

1. Init your flutter project:

    ```
    cd flutter_project_dir
    flr init
    ```
    
    > The `flr init` command generates `Flrfile.yaml` file and specifies package [r_dart_library](https://github.com/YK-Unit/r_dart_library) in `pubspec.yaml` for project.
    >
    > **Attention:**
    >
    > The Flutter SDK is currently in an unstable state, so if you get a build error of `r_dart_library` , you can fix it by modify the dependent version of `r_dart_library`.
    >
    > You can select the correct version of `r_dart_library` based on this [dependency relationship table](https://github.com/YK-Unit/r_dart_library#dependency-relationship-table).
    
2. Open `Flrfile.yaml` file, and edit it according to the prompts in the file to configure the asset directory paths that needs to be scanned by Flr, such as:

   ```
    assets:
    
      # config the image asset directories that need to be scanned
      # supported image assets: [".png", ".jpg", ".jpeg", ".gif", ".webp", ".icon", ".bmp", ".wbmp", ".svg"]
      # config example: - lib/assets/images
      images:
        - lib/assets/images
    
      # config the text asset directories that need to be scanned
      # supported text assets: [".txt", ".json", ".yaml", ".xml"]
      # config example: - lib/assets/texts
      texts:
        - lib/assets/jsons
        - lib/assets/yamls
   ```

3. Monitor the asset changes and auto specify assets and generate `R.dart` for your flutter project:

     ```shell
     flr monitor
     ```

     > The `flr monitor` command launches a monitoring service that continuously monitors asset changes for your project. 
     >
     > The monitoring service monitors the asset directories configured in `Flrfile.yaml`, and if it detects any asset changes, it will automatically execute `flr generate` command which will perform a assets scan for the asset directories configured in `Flrfile.yaml`, then automatically specifies scanned assets in `pubspec.yaml`, and generates `R.dart` file. 
     >
     > You can terminate this monitoring service by manually pressing `Ctrl-C`.

4. Press `Ctrl-C` to terminate the monitoring service if you want. 



*If you want to manually trigger the auto service which can automatically specify assets and generate `R.dart ` for your flutter project, you can run this command:*  

```shell
flr generate
```
> *The `flr generate` command does once a assets scan for the asset directories configured in `Flrfile.yaml`, then automatically specifies scanned assets in `pubspec.yaml`, and generates `R.dart` file.*



**Attention:**  all commands MUST be runned in your flutter project root directory.

## R.dart

After you run `flr generate` or `flr monitor`, Flr will automatically scan the assets based on the asset directory configuration in `Flrfile.yaml`, then specify scanned assets in `pubspec.yaml`, and generate the `R.dart` file.

`R.dart` defines several `R_X` asset management classes: `R_Image`, `R_Svg`, `R_Text`. These asset management classes are used to manage the asset IDs of the respective asset types:

- `R_Image`: manage the asset IDs of non-svg type image assets ( `.png`, `.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.gif`, `.webp`, `.icon`, `.bmp`, `.wbmp` )
- `R_Svg`: manage the asset IDs of svg type image assets
- `R_Text`: manage the asset IDs of text type image assets ( `.txt`, `.json`, `.yaml`, `.xml` ) 

`R.dart` allows flutter developer to  apply the asset in code by referencing it's asset ID. Here are some simple examples:

```dart
import 'package:flutter_r_demo/R.dart';

// sameName.png
var normalImageWidget = Image(
  width: 113,
  height: 128,
  image: R_Image.sameName,
);

// sameName.gif
var gifImageWidget = Image(
  image: R_Image.sameName_gif,
);

// $$test$.svg
var svgImageWidget = Image(
  width: 100,
  height: 100,
  image: R_Svg.a$$test$(width: 100, height: 100),
);

// $%^&test.json
var jsonString = await R_Text.a$___test_json();

// ~!@*test.yaml
var yamlString = await R_Text.a____test_yaml();

```
